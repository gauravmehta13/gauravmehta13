# Gaurav Yadav

**Senior Flutter Engineer** specializing in health-tech ecosystems, native platform bridges, and scalable mobile architectures.

Currently leading mobile engineering at [Caremonitor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/caremonitor/id1359688906) (Australia) — building the future of remote patient monitoring.

## 🎯 What I Do

I bridge the gap between Dart and native platforms to solve complex mobile challenges:

- **Health-Tech Integration**: Engineered custom MethodChannels for Bluetooth Low Energy medical devices (iHealth SDK), syncing real-time vitals from hardware to Flutter apps
- **Clean Architecture at Scale**: Architected offline-first mobile ecosystems using Provider + Drift, achieving 100% code reuse across iOS/Android
- **Open Source Impact**: Contributed to Flutter's official `go_router` package (500K+ downloads) and maintain production packages used by thousands of developers
